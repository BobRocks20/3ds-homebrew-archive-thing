# 3ds-homebrew-archive-thing
A "repository" of homebrew apps/games whose source code is only available, compiled by me. This project will not actually start until I get my Windows laptop back. Before you ask, this was written on a chromebook. (kill me-)

# Things I plan to add
* factcrow3ds
* 3dfrogr (the game pre-compiled was never released)
* Scratch3ds (owner is inactive. idk if he still accepts testing.) <br>
...and a bunch of others.

*insert gif of ptr episode 16 here*
